Pokemon Go was released this past weekend. It's an augmented reality game, where
players can walk around in the real world and catch [Pokemon][pokemon] with
their smartphones. For technologists, it's been a surprise how fast installs
and usage of [Pokemon have grown and surpassed the installs for other popular apps][pokemon-overtakes],
like Tinder, Whatsapp, and Instagram.

As of late (in the last year or two) there was the sentiment of
the [end of apps as we know it][end-of-apps]. Smartwatches and services like
Google Now were coming out that broke out chunks of information for consumption
across different devices. Innovation comes in fits and starts, and for mobile
apps, there was a general feeling that there was nothing left to invent.

But then when Pokemon came out, we get sentiments like this, and lots of
people retweeting it.

But these game mechanics and type of game have been around for the better part
of a decade, at least. In 2005, I was thinking about location based games by
making a game called Mobtropolis. It was a photo scavenger hunt, where
you took photos of adventurous things that you did, and challenged other people to
do the same. Needless to say, it was too early. This was pre-iphone. People were just getting
use to sharing photos online with their real identities.

But lest you think I'm posing myself as an early genius--I'm not.
Even as early as 2000, there was a Japanese collections
game (the name escapes me now) where mobile players could walk around town and
collect virtual items. The items belonged in set, and one of the goals was to
collect as many complete sets as possible. In addition, players can play on
the web as well, directing their team on an overhead map, like an RTS game,
while the players in the field were like their troops.

On the US side, there's been plenty of such Augmented Reality (AR) and Alternate
Reality Games (ARG). There's [ilovebees][ilovebees] and [Ingress][ingress], which
is the same company that built Pokemon Go.

None of these earlier games were nearly as popular as Pokemon Go, by at least
an order of magnitude. So the question then is why? As any maker of augmented
reality games will attest, most people want to play games in one place. It's really
hard to get them out of the house to make a game.

On the acquisition side of the equation, I think Pokemon Go says more about the
draw of the brand than it does about augmented reality itself. There are pretty
similar mechanics between Pokemon Go and Ingress, the difference being the
story between the two.

Pokemon has the advantage of being a story that middle school kids grew up with.
Middle school is a time where you're old enough to remember nostalgically, but
young enough not to be infected with a dismissive attitude teenagers tend to have.
Many kids at that age still had their imagination intact, and given the story
plus the cuteness of the pokemon, it's a world that many kids wanted to inhabit.
How many of them secretly wished Pokemon lived in their backyard?

In addition, the whole premise of the show are adventurers wandering the world
in search of pokemon, where the actual mechanics of the game are baked into the
story, making a great fit.

To me, the growth that you see with Pokemon Go isn't an indication that AR is ready
for primetime, but rather the power of good story telling. If you can capture
the imaginations of people into which a world they want to live in--especially
if that world is something they wished for as middle school children--they will
turn that into nostalgia for you.

And nostalgia is what gets people over the initial barrier of moving around to
play a game.

I'm starting to understand what Palmer Luckey is saying, that
[VR is fundamentally a communications device][vr-communications]. Storytelling
has always been baked into how we human relate to the world, and it's not going
to change between the different mediums. The difference will be how we're able
to tell stories. From [Kurt Vonnegut's story curves][six-main-arcs] to
[Pixar's storytelling nuggest][pixar-story-rules], it may be prudent to learn how to tell stories,
even as a technologist and product designer for VR.
