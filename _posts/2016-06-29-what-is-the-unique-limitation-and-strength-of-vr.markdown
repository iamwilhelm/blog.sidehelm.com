Virtual reality is a relatively old concept when measured in tech time. It
dates back to [Morton Heilig][heilig], who wrote about and invented the [Sensorama][sensorama]
in 1962. But the form that we recognize today as VR was developed by
Ivan Sutherland in 1968, with a [head mounted display][sword-of-damocles].
Still, it was limited by the technology at the time, but if you squint enough,
you can see their vision of being immersed somewhere else.

The idea of being in an alternate reality lends itself to lots of narrative
possibilities. You can be anywhere else at any time, even if it's not somewhere
that actually exists in reality. And the interplay between what's real and what's
not had always been an area of ripe exploration for story tellers from
[Zhangzi's butterfly dreams][butterfly-dream] to
[Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash][snow-crash].

Though VR triggers deep human desires and captures the imagination, there are
physical and technological constraints. Understanding its limitations gives us
a more realistic assessment of its near term possibilities.

But if we only look at near term limitations, we'd just be cynics and blinded from
its potential. Hence, it's important to understand its unique strengths as a
medium peeking out behind the veil of limitations.

## Limitations

What are the limits of virtual reality, and how should that inform us what it's
good for?

### Nausea and movement

When a user moves in VR with their head and their body, the view changes. That's
what makes the experience immersive. However, if they're on a moving platform,
but their bodies don't feel the acceleration, that can induce nausea. Hence,
the cardinal rule of VR is to never move the camera for the player.
That also means a fundamental limitation of VR is that any immersive experience
has to deal with the confines of the physical space in the real world.

The best experiences in VR so far takes the physical limitation into the mechanics
of the game. In Job Simulator 2050, the in-game jobs are ones where you're usually only
moving around in a limited physical space. There are many turret gunner and longbow
games, simply because the mechanics of the game naturally keeps you in one place.

But, there's a vast number of other experiences we want that involve movement.
We've tried to solve the movement problem so far with teleportation mechanics in-game,
as well as [other experimental movement mechanics][controlling-movement-in-vr].

There are also hardware possibilities, such as a movement platform like [Omni][omni],
or technology to fool the inner ear, like the [Entrim 4D][entrim-4d]. With limited
space in the home, a movement platform might be considered an plausible buy.
It takes up the same amount of space as an exercise bike, and it lowers the
space requirements for movement in VR.

### Hardware limitations

VR requires large bandwidth requirements. Not only does the environment need to
run at 90 fps, but the resolution of the screens needs to increase. Currently,
the screens resolution is at 2K, which results in a screen door effect that
makes text difficult to read. Currently, it's hard to do any keyboard based
work in VR for this reason.

The Head Mounted Display is still a little too heavy for prolonged use. Though
the Oculus may be more comfortable, the current head set is still a little too
heavy for prolonged or very active use. And the current price for VR systems is
fairly pricy at $900. These aspects will slow adoptions,
but we should expect the price of components to follow the same price to power
trajectory of electronics in the past.

## Strengths

Given its limitations, what are the surprising strengths of VR? What can you do
in VR that you can't do in any other medium?

### Immersion

VR is surprisingly immersive, but it's a different kind of immersion than the
way good books are movies are immersive. Because our primary senses of sight and
sound are fooled, we feel like we're actually somewhere else. We go from being
passive observers to actually experiencing being somewhere.

It's also a way to delight, because now magic is possible. The magic of being
able to paint in space, and have brush-strokes that animate just delights people.

### Emotion Amplification

Because VR is immersive, it is also an emotion amplifier. I experienced this when
I was in the Steam Labs. I was being taught how to use the buttons, and when I
pushed the button, the tool shot confetti in the air. I was not only surprised,
but also delighted. And then I was curious at how delighted I was, as I kept
shooting confetti in the air.

Another friend told me when he was on a beach in VR, he felt his heart rate go
down because of how immersive it was.

### Presence

It doesn't take a lot of representation to feel like someone else is there. You
don't need a body or legs. You don't need facial expressions. Turns out, you just
need a head and hands with low-latency tracking, and reliable directional audio.

That's actually enough to feel that another person is actually there.

### Intuitive interface

In VR, there's no mapping between the motion you do in the real world, with
what's happening in the digital world. For the majority of people I've seen use
VR, they grasped it immediately.

### Spatial reasoning

Users in VR can now use the spatial reasoning to see things in 3D.

## Conclusion

The best sort of applications for VR right now are gaming and interactive
environments where users can experience social interactions or magic.
