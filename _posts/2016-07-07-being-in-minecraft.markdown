Trying out [Vivecraft][vivecraft] for the first time, I actually feel like I'm
in the minecraft world. I think the difference is the feeling that you're actually
there, and you can see exactly how big 1m cubes are.

The teleportation mechanics really takes away from a sense that you're there though.
I really wonder if people would be willing to also buy a movement pad that lets
you move through the world. But until a better movement mechanics comes about
that doesn't induce VR sickness, it's not going to be a fully immersive experience
for expansive worlds like minecraft.

But still, it is pretty awesome to be in a world, rather than just looking
at the world through a window. Not all games, even ones that seem like they'd
be a good fit, will be able to make the transition to VR. VR games will have
to be built with the medium in mind.
