Virtual reality is an old concept in tech time. It dates back from the 1950's to
[Morton Heilig][heilig], who wrote about and invented the [Sensorama][sensorama]
in 1962. But the form that we recognize today as VR was developed by
Ivan Sutherland in 1968, with a [head mounted display][sword-of-damocles].
Still, it was limited by the technology at the time, but if you squint enough,
you can see their vision of being immersed not just somewhere else, but a place
not of this world.

The idea of being in an alternate reality lends itself to lots of narrative
possibilities. You can be anywhere else at any time, even if it's not somewhere
that actually exists in reality. And the interplay between what's real and what's
not had always been an area of ripe exploration for story tellers from
[Zhangzi's butterfly dreams][butterfly-dream] to
[Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash][snow-crash].

Though VR really captures deep human desires and imagination, there are realistic
physical and technological constraints put on any industry or platform. In addition,
all mediums have an innate characteristic that needs to be experienced to be
understood. That means what we imagine VR to be great for would misalign with
current and near term future realities without a good understanding of its limitations.
But even more importantly, is to understand its unique strengths that are barely
peeking out behind the veil of limitations.

## Limitations of virtual reality

What are the limits of virtual reality, and how should that inform us what it's
good for? When considering this, we should be aware of which limitation results
from current technological and cultural limitations, and which are limitations
of the nature of the medium itself.

Limitations of the former category are easier to spot, because the test for it
is easier to run. Take the diff between our imagination and what's currently
possible (or even what's acceptable), and that gap should should us the magnitude
of the limitation.

### Nausea

When a user moves in VR with their head and their body, the view changes. That's
what makes the experience immersive. However, if they're on a moving platform,
but their bodies don't feel the acceleration, that can induce nausea.

Our bodies are fine-tuned for the world we live in, though eons of evolution. Usually,
when there's a mismatch between what we see and what we feel, we believe we've
been poisoned, so that's why our bodies react the way it does.

The cardinal rule of VR is that you never move the camera for the player.
That also means a fundamental limitation of VR is that any immersive experience
has to deal with the confines of the physical space in the real world.

### Movement

The best experiences in VR so far takes the physical limitation into the mechanics
of the game. In Job Simulator 2050, the in-game jobs are ones where you're usually only
moving around in a limited physical space. There are many turret gunner and longbow
games, simply because the mechanics of the game naturally keeps you in one place.

But, there's a vast number of other experiences we want that involve movement.
We've tried to solve the movement problem so far with teleportation mechanics in-game,
as well as [other experimental movement mechanics][controlling-movement-in-vr].

There are also hardware possibilities, such as a movement platform like [Omni][omni],
or technology to fool the inner ear, like the [Entrim 4D][entrim-4d]. With limited
space in the home, a movement platform might be considered an plausible buy.
It takes up the same amount of space as an exercise bike, and it lowers the
space requirements for movement in VR.

## Strengths

Given its limitations, what are the surprising strengths of VR? What can you do
in VR that you can't do in any other medium?

### Immersion

VR is surprisingly immersive. When there's a table, and there's an object you
want to grab on the other side, you'll find yourself leaning over the table.
It's uncomfortable when you're inside someone or something, so you'll naturally
move out of it.

### Emotion Amplification

Because VR is immersive, it is also an emotion amplifier. I experienced this when
I was in the Steam Labs. I was being taught how to use the buttons, and when I
pushed the button, the tool shot confetti in the air. I was not only surprised,
but also delighted. And then I was curious at how delighted I was.

Another friend, Ryan, related to me that when he was at a beach, he could feel
his heart rate go down, because he was at the beach the whole time.

### Presence

It doesn't take a lot of representation to feel like someone else is there. You
don't need a body or legs. You don't need facial expressions. Turns out, you just
need a head and hands with low-latency tracking, and reliable directional audio.
